## Overview ##
Welcome.  Thanks for checking out this small but useful plugin to add direct Groovy support to JMeter.

Inspired by [Alexandru Popescu's blog post about running Groovy scripts as JMeter samplers.](http://themindstorms.wordpress.com/2007/01/10/groovy-support-for-jmeter)  This project uses [JMeter's](http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/) bean plugin architecture to create a simple sampler that runs any arbitrary [Groovy script.](http://groovy.codehaus.org/)

To use this plugin, just simply drop in the JAR to your JMETER\_HOME/lib/ext directory and you're all set.

Email with any questions, submit defects for improvements, or let me know if you'd like to contribute code to the project.

All the best,
`-Matthew McCullough`

## Why Groovy? ##
Groovy fits well into the performance and load testing world where scripts are changed often and on-the-fly and makes accessing all types of resources and parsing XML extremely simple.
